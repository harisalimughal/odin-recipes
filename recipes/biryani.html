    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Biryani is a flavorful and aromatic dish that originated in South Asia, particularly in the Indian subcontinent. It's a mixed rice dish made with fragrant basmati rice, meat (such as chicken, mutton, beef, or seafood), and a blend of spices</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Basmati rice</li>
        <li>Meat (chicken, mutton, beef, or seafood)</li>
        <li>Yogurt</li>
        <li>Onions</li>
        <li>Tomatoes</li>
        <li>Ginger-garlic paste</li>
        <li>Green chilies</li>
        <li>Fresh coriander leaves</li>
        <li>Mint leaves</li>
        <li>Spices (such as cumin, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, bay,leaves, and saffron)</li>
        <li>Ghee or oil</li>
        <li>Fried onions (for garnish)</li>
        <li>Lemon wedges (for serving)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><b><h3>Marinate the Meat:</h3></b></li>
             <p>Marinate the meat with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, chopped green chilies, chopped mint leaves, chopped coriander leaves, and spices (like turmeric, red chili powder, cumin powder, coriander powder). Allow it to marinate for at least 30 minutes to overnight in the refrigerator for maximum flavor.</p>

        <li><b><h3>Prepare the Rice:</h3></b></li>
             <p>Wash and soak the basmati rice for about 30 minutes. Then, boil it until it's about 70-80% cooked. Drain the rice and keep aside.</p>
        
        <li><b><h3>Prepare the Gravy:</h3></b></li>
             <p>Heat ghee or oil in a large pot. Add sliced onions and  cook until they turn golden brown.
                Add chopped tomatoes and cook until they soften.
                Add marinated meat and cook until it's partially done
            </p>


        <li><b><h3>Layering:</h3></b></li>
             <p>In a separate large pot, layer the partially cooked    rice over the meat gravy.
                Sprinkle some fried onions, chopped coriander leaves, and mint leaves over the rice.
                Dissolve saffron in warm milk and drizzle it over the rice for color and aroma.</p>
        

        <li><b><h3>Dum Cooking:</h3></b></li>
            <p>Cover the pot tightly with a lid (you can seal it with dough) and cook on low heat (dum) for about 20-25 minutes. This allows the flavors to meld together and the rice to absorb the aroma of the spices.</p>

        <li><b><h3>Serve:</h3></b></li>
            <p>Once done, gently mix the rice and meat together.
                Serve hot biryani garnished with fried onions, chopped coriander leaves, and mint leaves.
                Serve with raita (yogurt sauce), salad, and lemon wedges on the side.</p>

    </ol>
    <p>Biryani variations exist across different regions, each with its own unique flavor profiles and cooking techniques. Whether it's Hyderabadi biryani, Lucknowi biryani, or Kolkata biryani, this dish is beloved for its rich flavors and aromatic spices.</p>
