    <p>Korma is a flavorful and creamy curry dish that originated in South Asia, particularly in the Indian subcontinent. It typically consists of meat (such as chicken, mutton, or beef) or vegetables cooked in a rich, aromatic gravy made with onions, tomatoes, yogurt or cream, and a blend of spices. Korma is known for its creamy texture and mild yet fragrant flavors, often featuring ingredients like almonds, cashews, and saffron.
